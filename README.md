# Calc X

## Instructions

* Look through the starting files provided in this repository. You will find the logic of the calculator app in `modules/percentage.js` and `modules/aspect-ratio.js`. 
* Export the functions in the operations files.
* Import the functions to `modules/index.js` and add the functionality to the UI in the `index.js` file.
* The calculation result should update while the user is entering values, so no submit buttons are needed.
* Do not forget to add the `index.js` file at the end of the `index.html` file. Don't change anything else in `index.html`.
